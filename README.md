# About MobileLLM Demo

This project is a demo app to showcase how to use a locally running Large Language Model (LLM) combined with a vector database designed to assist developers in adding ChatGPT features secure and for free.

## Early prototype

We currently support the RWKV model that can run using less than 2GB of RAM. In the roadmap, we plan to incorporate more potent models such as Llama2 and Mistral to provide an even more robust solution.

Furthermore, the following updates will also include smoother integrations. We aim to provide an easier way to connect CoreData and SwiftData with the vector database, thus bridging the gap between your data entities and knowledge enhancement functionalities.
